# Dave Green Games

This is the place for all my major game dev projects. I am currently working on my own game engine based on the great raylib framework called Shape Engine. My major game project right now is Galaxy Unknown and I use Shape Engine to develop it.

Shape Engine is a simple 2d game engine focusing on drawing elements on the fly rather than using sprites. It has a built-in collision system, a simple ui system, and many other helpful features. [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/shapeengine)

This repository contains various demo projects to showcase ShapeEngineÂ´s features. Ranging from a minimal setup project to small complete games like asteroids.

Galaxy Unknown is a 2d top-down space shooter similar to Bytepath/ Bit Blaster with some elements of Deep Rock Galactic and my own ideas mixed in. [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/galaxyunknown)
