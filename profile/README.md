# Dave Green Games

This is the place for all my major game dev projects.

I am currently working on Galaxy Unknown, a 2d top down space shooter similar to Bytepath/ Bit Blaster with some elements of Deep Rock Galactic and my own ideas mixed in.
## Some of the main features:
- Weapon Builder (build your weapon out of a frame, a projectile, and damage type).
- Many different player ships to choose from.
- Perk Cards for customizing your build.
- Many different enemies.
- A lot of mayhem and destruction.
- Randomly generated maps.
- Bosses, Mission and Wormholes!
